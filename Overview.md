### 1. Which package/library did you select?
- I selected the [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/index.html) library for Python.

### 2. What is the package/library?
 - Matplotlib is used to make visualizations of data in Python [[ref]](https://matplotlib.org/).
 - Its main use comes with plots. There are many different types of plots. There are plots used for pairwise data, statistical distributions, gridded data, 3D, and volumetric data, and more[[ref]](https://matplotlib.org/stable/plot_types/index).
 - No matter what type of plot it is though, the plot displays the data given to it visually either through [Jupyter Lab](https://jupyter.org/) or another custom GUI [[ref]](https://matplotlib.org/)
 - There are various ways of inputting data into a plot, but the most common one is using arrays or [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) arrays, but you can also use DataFrames and Series from Pandas like I did [[ref]](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/explain/quick_start.html#quick-start)
 - There are a bunch of different parameters you can give to your plots to customize them, you can pretty much make them look any way you'd like [[ref]](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.plot.html)

 ### 3. What are the functionalities of the package/library?
 - Plots are the main functionality of Matplotlib, they are what allow you to visually display data in graphs and the like.
 - There are several different types of plots like I had mentioned in the pervious section. here are some examples of plots being created [[ref]](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/visualization.html#basic-plotting-plot):

- Figures are what make plots work, a figure is what the plot is visually placed upon.
- Figures can be created as any size and can be laid out in various different ways, but all you need to create a plot is a blank one [[ref]](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.figure.html).

### 4. When was it created? 
- Matplotlib was created in 2003 and was created to emulate MATLAB graphical commands in Python [[ref]](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/project/history.html)

### 5. Why did you select this package/library?
- I selected matplotlib because I wanted to expand on my previous exploration activity that I did using pandas. I found out that matplotlib had functionality with pandas so I looked into it and thought it would be really cool to be able to visually graph the spreadsheets that were made using my project for the first exploration activity.

### 6. How did learning the package/library influence your learning of the language?
- While matplotlib didn't teach me as much about Python itself as pandas did, it did help me learn how multiple different libraries interacted with each other and the problems that you can face when trying to do so. I had several errors that I had to fix when trying to create Plots using pandas DataFrames and I found myself going through both the matplotlib documentation and the pandas documentation to try and figure out a solution, so that was a bit different than what I was used to.

### 7. How was your overall experience with the package/library?
- I really enjoyed using matplotlib. Most of the time you are working with purely text, but having something visual to look at and edit is really cool and a nice change of pace. It was kind of confusing trying to figure out how to actually get the Plots to display, but once I figured out how Jupyter Lab worked it wasn't hard at all, and the only reason I had trouble with it at the start is because I didn't know anything about Jupyter Lab or how it worked.
